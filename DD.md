## 3. Functional Specifications

### 3.1 Core Functionalities
Our app aims to transform the mobile experience on Itch.io, a platform widely used by students and developers, especially evident in our Videogame course at Politecnico. We recognized the need for a dedicated mobile client, as relying on a mobile browser for Itch.io is cumbersome and limits functionality.

**Browsing Games**: The app will offer a seamless browsing experience, allowing users to explore a wide range of games hosted on Itch.io. It will feature advanced search filters, categories, and recommendations based on user preferences and previous interactions.

**Participating in Jams**: Users can participate in game jams, which are rapid game development events. The app will provide functionalities to register for jams, submit games, and view ongoing and upcoming events, enhancing engagement within the developer community.

**Accessing Developer Resources**: A dedicated section for developer tools and resources will be available. This includes access to forums, documentation, and the latest updates on game development tools, catering to the educational and professional needs of students and developers alike.

**Receiving Notifications**: Integration with Google Firebase will enable efficient management of notifications. Users will receive updates on new game releases, discounts, and popular games. Customizable notification settings will ensure users stay informed about what matters most to them.

### 3.2 Additional Features
Beyond the core functionalities, the app will incorporate unique features to enhance user engagement and interaction.

**GIF Commenting Using Giphy**: Recognizing the importance of community interaction, the app will integrate with Giphy, allowing users to express their thoughts and reactions to games through GIFs. This fun and interactive feature will foster a vibrant and engaging community space.

**Home Screen Widgets**: To keep users updated with minimal effort, the app will feature customizable home screen widgets. These widgets will display the latest game releases, updates, and personalized content, ensuring users never miss out on exciting Itch.io content.

**Personalized Game Recommendations**: Leveraging user data and preferences, the app will offer personalized game suggestions, enhancing user discovery and exploration within the platform.

**Offline Access**: Considering the on-the-go usage patterns of mobile users, key features like browsing games and accessing developer resources will be available offline, making the app more accessible and convenient.

**Cross-platform Synchronization**: For users accessing Itch.io on multiple devices, the app will synchronize data and preferences across platforms, providing a consistent and unified experience.

Developed in Flutter, this app is not just a mobile client for Itch.io; it's a gateway to an enriched, community-focused, and developer-friendly gaming world. We appreciate your time and look forward to your valuable feedback.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Choosing Flutter

In selecting Flutter for app development, we acknowledge its robust capabilities in crafting high-quality, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This cross-platform development framework, powered by the Dart programming language, is a game-changer for efficient app development.

**Advantages of Flutter:**
- **Cross-Platform Efficiency:** Flutter allows us to write one codebase for both iOS and Android platforms, significantly reducing development time and resources.
- **Rich Widget Catalog:** With a comprehensive array of customizable widgets, Flutter makes it easier to create a responsive and attractive UI that aligns with Itch.io's design aesthetics.
- **Performance:** Flutter's engine renders directly onto the canvas provided by the platform, which means there is no need for a bridge to communicate with native components. This results in high-performance applications that feel smooth and native.
- **Hot Reload:** This feature enhances developer productivity by enabling instant viewing of code changes without the need for a full rebuild.
- **Strong Community and Support:** Flutter's growing community and the support from Google ensure a wealth of resources and regular updates.

### 4.2 Architecture Overview
The architecture of our Itch.io app consists of two main components: the front-end built with Flutter and the back-end services, primarily using Firebase. Here’s how we plan to structure these components:

**Front-End (Flutter):**
- **User Interface:** Develop screens for game browsing, jam participation, notifications, and more using Flutter widgets. The design will be responsive to accommodate various device sizes.
- **State Management:** Employ state management solutions like Provider or Bloc to efficiently manage the app's state for a reactive and maintainable codebase.
- **Local Data Storage:** Implement local storage solutions (like SQLite or Hive) for offline data access and caching.

**Back-End (Firebase and Other Services):**
- **Firebase Authentication:** Manage user sign-ins and registrations for a secure experience.
- **Firebase Cloud Firestore:** Store and sync app data like user preferences, game lists, and comments in real-time across devices.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):** Handle push notifications for game updates, new releases, and other alerts.
- **Giphy API:** Integrate with Giphy for GIF comments, which involves fetching GIFs based on user queries and displaying them in the app.

**Interaction Between Front-End and Back-End:**

- The Flutter front-end will communicate with Firebase services for data storage, retrieval, and real-time updates. For instance, when a user comments on a game, the comment is stored in Firestore and is immediately visible to all users.
- Firebase Authentication will manage user login sessions, and Firestore will keep user-specific data like favorites and settings, which the Flutter app will fetch and render.
- FCM will send push notifications to the app, which Flutter will capture and display to the user.
